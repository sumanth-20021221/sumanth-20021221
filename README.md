# 👋 Hi, I'm Sumanth Gadepalli

### 🧠 AI/ML Research & Systems Engineer | Graph AI Enthusiast  
Bridging the gap between **cutting-edge ML research** and **production systems** with a strong foundation in **LLMs**, **RAG pipelines**, and **Graph Databases**.

---

## 🔍 Current Focus

- 🧠 **LLM Engineering**: OpenAI, Anthropic, LLaMA, Mixtral, Gemini
- 🔁 **RAG Pipelines**: Semantic search, vector DB integration, query planning
- 🧱 **Neo4j & Graph ML**: Designing graph-based knowledge systems for relational reasoning
- 🧬 **Model Training**: Finetuning, RLHF, bias/safety evaluation
- 🧰 **Infra & Tooling**: Data versioning, tracking, scalable deployment

---

## 🧩 What I Build

- 🔍 **LLM-Powered Applications**  
  Seamless integration with LLM APIs and open-source models  
  → Gemini, Claude, LLaMA, Mixtral, GPT

- 🔗 **Graph-AI Systems with Neo4j**  
  Building knowledge graphs and entity-relation explorers for better context in RAG/QA apps

- ⚙️ **ModelOps Pipelines**  
  ETL → Data labeling → Model training → Evaluation → API serving

- 🧠 **Evaluation & Benchmarking**  
  Bias detection, safety validation, internal metrics dashboards
